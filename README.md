### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### Continued development

- Working with SVGs, ran into some issues with scaling and need to become more confident with them. 
- Scalability for tablets, my solution worked well across most devices but on some of the tablets I checked, I wasn't able to scroll all the way to the bottom of the page, at least some part of the footer wasn't fully accessible.
